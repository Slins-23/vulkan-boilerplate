# Vulkan learning process


**I just recently started learning Vulkan and graphics programming from SCRATCH. Expect bad code and optimization. This is just a "toy" repository.**

This is just a repository where I will be recording some of my progress with Vulkan, use this as reference for future projects, and perhaps turn this into something else in the future, depending on how things go. Maybe a Minecraft Vulkan clone? I have always wanted to do something like that. The only thing holding me back is Vulkan's complexity and my inexperience, but I'm committed and I believe that I will be able to go through with it and develop something nice!
